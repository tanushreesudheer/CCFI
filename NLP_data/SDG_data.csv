This will include replacing inefficient mercury-based technology with more efficient technologies, such as shaker-tables and centrifuge systems that can increase gold recovery rates from 30% to 80%. Currently, low recovery rates cause miners to often return to previously mined areas when technology or economic circumstances favour them doing so. Improved recovery efficiency would make reprocessing of sites unnecessary and better facilitate cost- effective reforestation and recovery of mined sites.</p>",future,industry,adaptation,action,21686.0,22320.0,GUY-first_ndc-EN.html,7750
